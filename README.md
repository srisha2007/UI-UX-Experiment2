# UI-UX-Experiment2

## Aim:
To design responsive mobile and web layouts for an existing digital product by applying Gestalt principles, UI patterns, usability guidelines, and branding techniques â€” ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Algorithm:
Step 1: Select an Existing Case Study
Choose a real-world app or website as a reference (e.g., Zomato, Uber, Flipkart).
Understand the core purpose, target audience, and existing user flow.

Step 2: Apply Gestalt Principles
Study Gestalt principles such as proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, and figure-ground.
Incorporate these principles into layout wireframes to enhance visual hierarchy and organization.

Step 3: Design UI Layouts (Mobile and Web)
Use a design tool like Figma or Adobe XD to create mobile and web wireframes.
Add common UI elements like navigation bars, buttons, input fields, modals, and cards.
Follow responsive design best practices for different screen sizes.

Step 4: Integrate Interaction and Usability Features
Define and design interaction behaviors such as hover states, transitions, and feedback.
Ensure usability by following principles like consistency, feedback, affordance, and accessibility.
Simulate user journeys (e.g., onboarding, checkout, profile edit) in prototypes.

Step 5: Design a Brand Logo
Use Canva to design a simple brand logo that reflects the product's identity.
Follow branding guidelines: consistent colors, fonts, and scalable design.
Export and embed the logo into both web and mobile layouts.

Step 6: Review and Document
Review the final design for alignment, spacing, contrast, and flow.
Export layouts as images or interactive prototypes.
Document your design decisions and how each principle/tool contributed to the final output.

## Result:
Successfully designed responsive mobile and web layouts for an existing case study using key design principles. Applied Gestalt theory to improve visual structure, integrated standard UI components and patterns, and developed user interactions focused on usability. Created a custom brand logo using Canva, maintaining visual consistency across layouts. This process enhanced my skills in layout planning, responsive design, branding, and user-centered thinking.
